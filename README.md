# The Remote Mobbing Experience

In this workshop we want you to experience some of how we work everyday at Cucumber Ltd.

You are going to work others to collaboratively and iteratively create a compelling short story. You'll be given an ordered backlog of things to include. You must follow this order.

## Definition of done

* It must read like a piece of prose, not just a list of facts / items
* Your aim is to draw the reader in, it needs to be compelling

## Set up

* Join the zoom room given in the workshop
* Introduce yourself to your team mates in the breakout room
* One of the team should _fork_ this repository, and add everyone else as collaborators
* Talk everyone in your team through cloning the repository locally and adding their name to the AUTHORS file
* (You can always use the GitHub website to edit if necessary)
